# 🦠 COVID-19 Strain Analysis & Prediction (Streamlit App)

This project is an interactive Streamlit application designed to visualize and classify COVID-19 strains using Raman Spectroscopy data. It integrates a preprocessed dataset and a trained machine learning model to provide real-time predictions and insights about virus strain characteristics.

> Built as part of an applied machine learning research initiative at IIT Delhi.
